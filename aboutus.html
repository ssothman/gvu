							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>All of Gaza’s university campuses have been demolished by Israel, and many students, faculty, and administrators have been killed or maimed. While Gazan academics have persevered through decades of precarious living conditions and repression, the widespread destruction wrought in this war will likely push many to leave permanently to countries ready to accept these highly trained emigres. Given the cost and incubation period needed to produce PhDs, Gaza may become a higher education desert, depriving the Strip of a critical engine of its cultural and economic advancement.</p>
							<h2>Vision</h2>
							<p>Gaza Virtual University (GVU) supports the vitality of institutions of higher learning in Palestine through international collaboration.</p>
							<h2>Mission</h2>
					<p>Gaza Virtual University develops and operates a network of international universities and academics who support the continuity and advancement of higher learning institutions in Palestine. In particular, GVU:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Operates an information clearinghouse on the status of urgent needs identified by Gaza’s universities as they resume operation,</li>
						<li>Solicits international academic institutions and individual academics for teaching, research, and administrative support,</li>
						<li>Connects professors in Gaza with paid teaching, research, and consulting opportunities in the network,</li>
						<li>Recruits and appoints international academics to serve as volunteer GVU “faculty,” mirroring a university structure with departments and schools,</li>
						<li>Coordinates teams of GVU faculty who seek funding (e.g. project proposals, donations) on behalf of Palestinian (with special focus on Gaza initially) universities that request such assistance, and</li>
						<li>Serves as an information clearinghouse on philanthropic or other funding opportunities for Palestinian universities.</li>
						<li>Connects students from around the world with students in Palestine through activities such as tutoring, peer advising, hackathons, global design challenges (not an immediate goal).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>GVU aims to support indigenous Palestinian institutions and therefore does not offer certificate or degree programs directly to learners.</p>
					<h2>Envisioned roles for individual academics and university network partners</h2>
					<p>Individual GVU faculty members will forge research collaborations involving faculty in Palestine, work on teams to write grant proposals to raise funds for university priorities in Gaza, participate in mentorship activities, serve on GVU department committees (e.g. to interview new GVU recruits)</p>
					
					<p>University network partners will provide curricular teaching support to Gaza’s universities, will hire faculty in Gaza for online teaching roles outside Palestine, can host GVU faculty volunteers as adjunct faculty for online teaching in Gaza. Note: Where Gaza universities seek teaching support for their programs, GVU network partners provide that support through bilateral arrangements directly between the involved universities so as to assure standards and accountability.</p>
					<h2>Capabilities required of GVU</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>An online presence that can serve as a one-stop shop for the stakeholders</li>
						<li>Credibility with international and Palestinian academic institutions</li>
						<li>Effective channels of communication with senior leadership in Palestinian universities</li>
						<li>Effective channels to communicate with professors in Gaza</li>
						<li>Ability to recruit international academics who serve the mission</li>
						<li>Means to coordinate teams of GVU faculty (e.g. for funding proposal development)</li>
						<li>Means to fund necessary GVU staff and capabilities</li>
						<li>Ability to sign agreements, receive and disburse small levels of funding in the short term, and other related functions (initially through S4P or partner universities; as situation evolves GVU may need to become a legal entity)</li>
